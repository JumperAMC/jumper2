Mostly at the interface between industry and academia. I was a senior lecturer in entrepreneurship and innovation at the University of Bristol. I am often found at the early stages of a deep-tech start-up and have felt some of those ups and downs myself.\nMy full CV is avalable along with some (non-NDA covered) examples of the interesting stuff I’ve been involved with in the menu. Some of it is code, mostly python, and please feel free to use it if it will help!"
