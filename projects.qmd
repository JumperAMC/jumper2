This page lists some of the projects I have been involved in.

The list below is automatically generated from the `.qmd` and `.ipynb` files inside the `projects` folder. You should be able to directly download code and I've set it up so you can run things directly in google colab if you want to have a go. 


## Radar Recognition using Keras

I used Tensorflow and Keras to build a model capable of recognising events in a radar signal.

### Capturing data from my radar array

Under construction!

### Building the model from signals in Keras

[Using Keras to train and build the model](\projects\Keras_train_and_test_of_radar_signals.html)

## Workshops

I've been lucky enough to travel all over the world delivering innovation and commercialisation workshops

### Innovation in quantum engineering
Under construction

### From Benchtop to Business

Under construction
