Hi, I'm Andy Collins and I'm a multidisciplinary scientist with a specialism in commercialisation of emerging and cutting edge science. 

I'm a nanomaterials scientist by trianing and have worked extensively in the nanoscience and quantum engineering fields. I am a consultant and sometimes senior lecturer at the University of Bristol.
