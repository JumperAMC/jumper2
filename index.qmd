Hi, I'm Andy Collins and I'm a multidisciplinary scientist and lecturer with a specialism in commercialisation of emerging and cutting edge science. 

I'm a nanomaterials scientist by training and have worked extensively in the nanoscience and quantum engineering fields. Mostly at the interface between industry and academia. I was a senior lecturer in entrepreneurship and innovation at the University of Bristol. I am often found at the early stages of a deep-tech start-up and have felt some of those ups and downs myself. 

[My full CV](cv.qmd) is available along with some (non-NDA covered) examples of the interesting stuff I've been involved with in the menu. Some of it is code, mostly python, and please feel free to use it if it will help!
